        "\n",

        "LSTMs and GRUs are advanced types of RNNs designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and better capture long-range dependencies. They achieve this through \"gates\" that control the flow of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.1 Introduction to LSTMs\n",
        "\n",
        "LSTMs introduce a \"cell state\" in addition to the hidden state. This cell state acts as a conveyor belt, carrying information across many time steps. Gates (input, forget, output) regulate what information gets stored in, removed from, and read from the cell state.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.2 Introduction to GRUs\n",
        "\n",
        "GRUs are a simplified version of LSTMs. They combine the hidden state and cell state into a single \"hidden state\" and use fewer gates (update, reset) to control information flow. GRUs are computationally less expensive than LSTMs and often perform similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4.3 Implementing LSTMs and GRUs\n",
        "\n",
        "Keras and PyTorch provide `LSTM` and `GRU` layers that are straightforward to use, similar to `SimpleRNN`.\n",
