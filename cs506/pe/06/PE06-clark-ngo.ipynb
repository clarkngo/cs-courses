        "    * The best parameters found during training (`sf=1.15`, `mn=5`) yielded a very low average distance of `0.82` on the 5 training images. However, when these same parameters were applied to the 10 test images, the average distance was higher at `2.36`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * This difference between the training and testing score is a classic example of **overfitting**. The parameters were highly optimized for the specific five images in the training set but were not as generalizable to new, unseen images in the test set. A larger and more diverse training set (e.g., 50 images instead of 5) would likely help find more robust parameters and reduce this gap.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * The 3D plot and the results table were very informative. There was a clear \"valley\" (low error) for `scaleFactor` values between `1.10` and `1.25` and `minNeighbors` between `4` and `7`. Performance was significantly worse (high peaks) at very low `scaleFactor` values (e.g., `1.01-1.05`), which likely created too many false detections, and at high `minNeighbors` (e.g., `9-10`), which likely missed one or both eyes entirely.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * [cite_start]The most significant challenge was handling images where the detector found 0 or 1 eye, forcing the `measureDistance` function to apply the `10.0` penalty[cite: 28], which drastically increased the average error for that parameter pair.\n",
