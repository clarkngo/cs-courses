The easiest way to find the closest item to an arbitrary vector is simply to find the distance between the target vector and each item in the space, in turn, then sort the list from closest to farthest. The `closest()` function below does just that. By default, it returns a list of the ten closest items to the given vector.\n",

        "A common issue we have with text analysis is that some words are much more frequent than others and aren’t useful for classification. For example, words like “the”, “is”, and “a” are common English words that don’t convey much meaning. These words will differ from task to task depending on the domain of the text documents. If we are working with movie reviews, the word “movie” will be frequent but not useful. If we were working with email data, on the other hand, the word “movie” may not be frequent and would be useful.\n",
        "The simplest way to account for these overrepresented words is to divide word count by the proportion of text documents each word appeared in. For example, the document:\n",

        "“I loved this movie! It was great, great, great.”\n",

After we apply weights, “loved” has a score of 100 and “movie” has a score of 3. The score for “loved” is much higher relative to “movie”, indicating that we care about the word “loved” much more than “movie”.\n",
        "In fact, our score for “loved” is now 33 times larger than our score for “movie”. While we suspect that “movie” should be less important than “loved” for predicting whether a review is positive or negative, this relative difference might be too big. Very rare words — perhaps, misspelled words — will receive too much relative weight in our current weighting scheme.\n",
