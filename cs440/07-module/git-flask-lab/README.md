## âœ… Instructions

### ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Run, Commit, Branch

- Go to project folder `cd git-flask-lab`
- Run app `flask --app app.todo run`
- Open a new terminal
- Go to project folder `cd git-flask-lab`
- Run tests `python -m unittest discover tests`
- Create a new branch `feature/due-date`
- Modify `add_task()` to accept an optional `"due_date"` field
- Commit the changes with a clear message

---

### ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Merge Conflict (Solo Simulated)

- Create branch `bugfix/approach-a`: Fix `delete_task()` using an `if` check
- Create branch `bugfix/approach-b`: Fix `delete_task()` using `try/except`
- Merge both into main to trigger a conflict
- Resolve the conflict manually

---

### ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Git History Tools

Run the following and write observations in `answers/part3.md`:
- `git log --oneline`
- `git diff HEAD~1`
- `git blame app/todo.py`

---

### ðŸ”¹ Part 4: Mistake Recovery

- Make and commit a bad change (e.g. remove all tasks from `/list`)
- Use:
  - `git reset` (soft)
  - `git revert` (clean history)
  - `git stash` (temporary save)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Part 5: Pull Request Simulation

- Push a new branch with a new feature or test
- Open a Pull Request on GitHub
- Leave a comment, merge using "Squash and Merge"
- Document what happened in `answers/part5.md`

---
