  "description": "In 1998, a crew member aboard the USS Yorktown entered a zero into a form field. The system did not validate the input, causing a division-by-zero error that crashed the shipâ€™s propulsion system. The failure left the ship stranded and in need of towing, revealing a critical gap in input validation and error handling.",
